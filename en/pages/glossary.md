## A
### Aorta
The main artery in the human body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen, where it splits into two smaller arteries (the common iliac arteries). The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation.

### Endocardium
The thin layer of tissue heart that lines the heart’s chambers and valves. The cardiac conduction system is located in this layer of the heart.

### Inferior vena cava
The inferior vena cava (or IVC) is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart. Its walls are rigid and has valves so the blood does not flow down via gravity. It is formed by the joining of the right and the left common iliac veins, usually at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

The inferior vena cava is the lower ("inferior") of the two venae cavae, the two large veins that carry deoxygenated blood from the body: the inferior vena cava carries blood from the lower half of the body whilst the superior vena cava carries blood from the upper half of the body.

### Isotope
Atoms of identical Z (atomic number) but differing A (atomic mass number) are called isotopes of a given element.

### Myocardium
The thickest layer of the heart made of pure muscle and it gets damaged during a heart attack. It makes up the bulk of the heart.

### Pericardium
The sac that encloses the heart. It is also known as the outermost layer of the heart.

### Pulmonary artery
An artery in the pulmonary circulation that carries deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs.

### Pulmonary vein
The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart.
